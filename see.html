                Google has special cameras and super-duper map makers who take you on virtual journeys to far-off places like the tall and snowy Himalayas, 
                the wild and green Amazon rainforest, and even the awesome Great Barrier Reef, which is like a super cool underwater wonderland in our own big backyard!

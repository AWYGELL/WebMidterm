                In a fun show called "News Time‚Äù, reporters talk about things like cool animals and clever kids' inventions, which are perfect for children who are 6 years old and younger. 
                But the best part is when these kids explain big news stories in their own words. 
                For example, they once talked about the Black Lives Matter protests and shared what they thought about words like "protest," "racism," and "movement."

                They bring in a special kid to the show, and then two grown-ups show up, both saying they know a ton about something. But guess what? One of them is telling a big fib! 
                It's up to the kid to listen carefully, ask clever questions, and use their super smart thinking to figure out who's for real and who's just pretending.
